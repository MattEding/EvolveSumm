News of the hormone, Amylin, was reported by Dr. Garth Cooper of New Zealand to the International Diabetes Federation. Researchers believe that amylin, found in high levels in the diabetic pancreas, appears to be responsible for the obesity and lower insulin secretion and effectiveness found in Type II diabetics. Obesity is currently thought of as a cause, not an effect of, diabetes. Insulin normally controls blood sugar; in type II diabetes it becomes ineffective and blood sugar rises. Complications include kidney disease, blindness, and gangrene of the extremities. Researchers hope to develop substances that block amylin's action.\\nIntroduction:\""

      "AS THE NRA waged its war in the West, Marion P. Hammer, a 50-year-old \n",

      "battleground in Tallahassee, Fla., a packed meeting room in the state's House \n",
      "of Representatives. \n",
      "\n",
      "A subcommittee was getting ready to vote on a bill that would ban a list of \n",
      "semiautomatic assault weapons, and Hammer had asked to speak against it. Only 4 \n",
      "feet, 11 inches tall, she could barely be seen as she took the podium. Her gray \n",
      "slacks, blue ruffled blouse and blue suede jacket complemented her steel-blue \n",
      "eyes but belied her credentials: prize-winning marksman and hardball lobbyist \n",
      "for the Florida NRA. \n",

      "To her supporters, Hammer represents all that is strong about the NRA; to her \n",
      "detractors, much that is weak. \n",
      "\n",
      "Attacking the crux of the bill, Hammer told the subcommittee: \"You cannot \n",
      "differentiate between semiautomatic firearms that look menacing and your \n",
      "routine sporting firearms because, functionally, they are the same.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, she dealt acidly with one of the NRA's prickliest political problems: \n",
      "\"There are some law-enforcement officers who are NRA members who are against \n",
      "us. I would suggest to you that it would not be the first time that the fox has \n",
      "been in the henhouse.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, as NRA Washington lobbyist Baker had done in his letter to Arizona gun \n",
      "owners, Hammer charged that a loosely worded definition in the Florida bill \n",
      "would inadvertently ban all semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. That is, the ban \n",
      "would cover not just the targeted guns -- the ones with folding stocks that \n",
      "make them easy to conceal, pistol grips, huge ammunition clips and flash \n",
      "suppressors that, according to police, make it easy to spray bullets from the \n",
      "hip. But doomed as well, she claimed, would be firearms of traditional design \n",
      "long used by hunters and target shooters in one of the nation's gun-owningest \n",
      "states. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Taking away firearms from law-abiding citizens who have lawfully owned them \n",
      "for decades is not the solution\" to violent crime, she declared. \n",
      "\n",
      "One might have expected the House subcommittee to reject the bill handily on \n",
      "that April day. After all, two years earlier, Hammer had led a phenomenal \n",
      "victory for the NRA in Florida, winning passage of measures that threw out all \n",
      "locally imposed gun restrictions. The action was so sweeping that many Sunshine \n",
      "Staters thought that they had been freed to carry guns openly, Wild West-style. \n",
      "The Legislature later closed that seeming loophole in the wake of widespread \n",
      "hoots about the \"Gunshine State.\" But it left intact all other provisions, \n",
      "including one making it much easier in many areas to obtain a concealed-weapon \n",
      "permit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hammer has skillfully built support for the changes in the gun laws over many \n",
      "years. Rising at 4 a.m. after less than four hours' sleep, chain-smoking \n",
      "filter-tip cigarettes, sipping diet sodas -- and aided only by one part-time \n",
      "staffer and a $125,000 yearly budget -- she tirelessly works Capitol corridors \n",
      "and grinds out newsletters aimed at firing up the NRA's 130,000 Florida members \n",
      "to contact their representatives. Once, she threw a party at a firing range for \n",
      "legislators, aides, spouses and children; hundreds feasted on shrimp and \n",
      "oysters, and many took shooting lessons from expert instructors. \n",
      "\n",
      "Testimonials to Hammer's lobbying efforts -- not to mention her marksmanship \n",

      "\n",
      "Despite her past successes, however, the House panel voted 5-1 to pass the \n",
      "assault-weapons bill along to the full Criminal Justice Committee. Hammer still \n",
      "would have several opportunities to halt the bill's progress. But the \n",
      "surprising setback symbolized the NRA's shifting fortunes, not only in Florida, \n",
      "but across the nation. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"The NRA has been unreasonable with their positions for so long, it's catching \n",
      "up with them now,\" asserted Rep. Ronald A. Silver, a Miami Beach Democrat who \n",
      "chairs the criminal justice panel. One of the NRA's major problems, he said, is \n",
      "that a number of legislative allies have been angered by its strong-arm tactics \n",
      "when the group decided they went astray. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dramatic evidence of this cropped up the day before the House action, when Sen. \n",
      "John A. Grant Jr., a conservative Tampa Republican who heads a companion Senate \n",
      "committee, was being interviewed about prospects for an assault-weapons ban. As \n",
      "Hammer sat casually on a table nearby, waiting to request that an NRA videotape \n",
      "be shown to the panel, Grant remarked that \"the gun lobby is very \n",
      "well-organized, and I give them credit for being able to rally the troops on \n",
      "very short notice.\" But asked if the NRA provides accurate information, he \n",
      "responded, with a backward glance at Hammer: \"Well, sometimes they get a little \n",
      "bit overzealous. When they said I was part of the Gestapo last year, that was a \n",
      "little out of order.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Hammer explained later that Grant was referring to a newsletter in which she \n",
      "had said that a bill in his committee \"sets up a modern-day Gestapo movement\" \n",
      "because it threatened to invalidate many concealed-weapon permits. \"I wasn't \n",
      "calling members of that committee Gestapo,\" she maintained. Nevertheless, Grant \n",
      "was so enraged that he had an aide call NRA officials in Washington to demand \n",
      "her removal. \n",
      "\n",
      "State Sen. George G. Kirkpatrick Jr. (D-Gainesville) protested in an interview \n",
      "that he had been savagely attacked by Hammer's group in his latest campaign \n",
      "despite a \"strong pro-gun\" voting record. \"They wrote the most vicious \n",
      "letters,\" he said. \"They called me Judas\" because he had backed a Senate \n",
      "leadership team viewed by the NRA as sympathetic to controls on handguns and \n",
      "assault weapons. Kirkpatrick, who easily won re-election, predicted that such \n",
      "tactics will backfire. \"Because of the NRA's unwillingness to sit down and work \n",

      "more difficult to get their mission accomplished,\" he said. \n",
      "\n",
